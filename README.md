# Security-in-Computing

This  course  is  designed to  provide  a basic  understanding security  theory  and  practice  for  modern computing environments.Students will acquire proficiency in a number of classic and modern symmetric and   public   key   cryptographic   methods.   Students   will   explore   important   topics   in   key   exchange mechanisms; modes of operation; malware attacks, vulnerabilities, and defenses; network, web, and email security; digital rights management; and legal and ethical issues. 

#### Vigenere
This assignment is a program that encrypts the alphabetic letters in a file using the Vigen√®re cipher. The program takes two command line parameters containing the names of the file storing the encryption key and the file to be encrypted. The program also generates output to the console (terminal) screen. More information on the assignment is in the assignment PDF in the Vigenere folder.

#### Checksum
This assignment is a program that calculates the checksum for the text in a file. The program takes two command line parameters. The first parameter takes the name of the input file for calculating the checksum. The second parameter checks for the size of the checksum (8, 16, or 32 bits). The program generates output to the console (terminal) screen.
